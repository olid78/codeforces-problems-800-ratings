# codeforces-problems-800-ratings

Hi .  I’m just diving into problem-solving on Codeforces, starting off with 800-rated problems to get the hang of things. Thought I’d share what I’m working on here, in case anyone else is practicing too. You’ll find both the problems and my solutions, so if you’re also figuring things out, feel free to check it out!

I’ll keep adding more as I (hopefully) get better, so if you’re on the same journey, maybe this can be a useful stop along the way. Let’s learn and level up together!
